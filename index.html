                        My name is Merlin Olviani Devi Poluan. People usually call me Merlin. To be honest, 
                        I do not know the meaning of my name, but one thing that I know,
                         my parents gave those names because they love me. 
                        I was born on October 19, 1997.

                        As a person, I like many things, but I also dislike some things. 
                        One of the things that I like to do is drawing or design. 
                        I also enjoy writing many things like essays and stories because 
                        I think it is good for improving the way i think and it is fun.

                        I was born in a simple family but in the midst of their simplicity, 
                        they are extraordinary to me. My mother's name is Jelie Maringka, 
                        and my father's name is Altien Wolther Poluan. 
                        My father passed away around two years ago.

        In my family, I am the third of three children and I am the youngest. 
        My eldest brother is a boy whose name is Sevendi Eldrige Rifki Poluan 
        and the second is a girl whose name is Sivvi Melinda Poluan. 
        The three of us grew up in one of the villages in Indonesia, 
        namely Wongkai Satu village, located in the eastern Ratahan sub-district. But now,  
        I am not leaving that village because I have been married to a very handsome boy in my view, 
        so, I have to follow him to live in his village. The name of the village is Sawangan,
        
        located in the Airmadidi sub-district.

        For my educational background, I studied at one of the famous universities
         in my province, North Sulawesi, namely Klabat University. I have studied 
         there since August 2018. I took English Education as my major and also 
         Computer Science as my minor. For me, personally, studying there is great 
         because it is possible for me to have a lot of friends, and also friendly teachers.
          In addition, I can gain a great deal there.
